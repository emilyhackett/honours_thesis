\chapter{Research Proposal}

This appendix details significant changes that exist between this thesis and the initial research proposal submitted in Semester 1.

The following table lists the changes made to the project in regards to the initial research proposal. The area of interest remained the same: namely, optimising strain estimation methods for use in the assessment of surgical margins in breast conserving surgery. However, the paradigm shift that occurred was from attempting to improve upon the image quality, to attempting to improve the speed at which the image could be produced. Therefore this thesis is structured to first look at speeding up the strain estimation process as much as possible, to enable real-time imaging, and only when that was achieved was the analysis of image quality returned to.
