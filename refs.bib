	abstract = {Biological tissue has intrinsic optical and mechanical properties that are linked to its structure and function, and are altered by pathologies such as cancer. Techniques for imaging these properties could, thus, aid in the detection, diagnosis, and understanding of disease. Birefringence is one such optical property, arising from structural and molecular anisotropies in tissue and, thus, a measure of the tissue microstructure. Similarly, many pathologies lead to a stiffening or softening of tissues, and, in principle, can be detected from changes in mechanical elasticity. Optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) is a minimally invasive optical imaging modality, with micrometre-scale resolution and millimetre-scale depth penetration, which can be extended to measure these tissue properties. This research combines three-dimensional {OCT} imaging with parametric modelling to develop signal processing methods for spatially resolved micro-scale measurements of tissue birefringence and elasticity, an approach referred to as parametric {OCT}.},

We compare theoretical predictions with experimental results and demonstrate a 12 {dB} improvement in strain sensitivity using weighted least squares compared to finite difference strain estimation and a 4 {dB} improvement over ordinary least squares strain estimation.

We report advances in the development of a new intraoperative tool, optical coherence micro-elastography, for the assessment of tumor margins on the micro-scale. We demonstrate an important step by conducting whole specimen imaging in intraoperative time frames with a wide-field scanning system acquiring mosaicked elastograms with overall dimensions of 50 \&\#x00D7; 50 mm, large enough to image an entire face of most lumpectomy specimens. This capability is enabled by a wide-aperture annular actuator with an internal diameter of 65 mm.

An upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. The strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. The strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. The dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. Tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.},

However, both the nature of biological signals and the use of micro-or minicomputers in such applications imply the need for simple, low-order, and fast differentiation methods, rather than sophisticated high-order algorithms. Responding to this need, we investigate here the low-pass first- and second-order digital differentiation from both theoretical and practical points of view, in order to achieve good and simple algorithms. In contrast with most of the research works previously done in this field, whose main aim was to achieve better accuracy even in the cost of using quite high-order algorithms, we restrict ourselves in this study only to low orders, being interested not only in the accuracy achieved, but also in the simplicity of the algorithm. After discussing the theoretical considerations concerning our optimum low-pass differentiation filters, we present our simple low-order filters and show them to be not only very convenient for use, but also almost optimum.},

	abstract = {An accurate intraoperative identification of malignant tissue is a challenge in the surgical management of breast cancer. Imaging techniques that help address this challenge could contribute to more complete and accurate tumor excision, and thereby help reduce the current high reexcision rates without resorting to the removal of excess healthy tissue. Optical coherence microelastography ({OCME}) is a three-dimensional, high-resolution imaging technique that is sensitive to microscale variations of the mechanical properties of tissue. As the tumor modifies the mechanical properties of breast tissue, {OCME} has the potential to identify, on the microscale, involved regions of fresh, unstained tissue. {OCME} is based on the use of optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) to measure tissue deformation in response to applied mechanical compression. In this feasibility study on 58 ex vivo samples from patients undergoing mastectomy or wide local excision, we demonstrate the performance of {OCME} as a means to visualize tissue microarchitecture in benign and malignant human breast tissues. Through a comparison with corresponding histology and {OCT} images, {OCME} is shown to enable ready visualization of features such as ducts, lobules, microcysts, blood vessels, and arterioles and to identify invasive tumor through distinctive patterns in {OCME} images, often with enhanced contrast compared with {OCT}.

	abstract = {6.1 {INTRODUCTION} ; The problem of the definition and the determination of an image quality criterion has long been and still is a major one in the field of image evaluation and assessment. A large variety of measures have been used, from a two-point resolution criterion to fidelity defect, etc. None of these measures is, however, completely satisfactory. In this chapter, we wish to discuss some of the simple criteria in terms of the intensity impulse response of the optical system. This allows us a preliminary look at the image assessment problem and also allows us to follow through further examples on the use of the intensity impulse response. We concern ourselves only with the Rayleigh and Sparrow criteria for two-point resolution; more sophisticated image quality criteria will be discussed in Chapter 19. ; 6.2 {TWO}-{POINT} {RESOLUTION} ; Historically, one of the first measures established for the evaluation of optical systems was to specify how well the system could resolve a two-point object. The two objects were incoherent with respect to each other. Idealized point objects are, of course, not essential; all we require is that the individual objects are not themselves resolved, i.e., the intensity impulse response of the system is much broader than the geometrical image of the object. Clearly, two objects which are themselves resolved would be observable as two individual objects for all separations. What we are trying to establish now is a criterion that will allow us to determine the presence of two objects when the objects themselves are not resolved. Under these circumstances, the image will consist of the sum of the intensity impulse response of the optical system located at each image pointâ€”in general, these two intensity distributions will overlap. What is the separation of the centers of the impulse responses and hence the separation of the objects that will allow us to distinguish them as two separate impulse responses and hence conclude that the object consisted of two distinct parts? Naturally, this type of discussion is only applicable if indeed the object to be imaged did consist of two equally bright unresolved objects.},

	abstract = {{AimThere} is debate as to what constitutes an adequate excision margin to reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence ({LRR}) after breast cancer surgery. We have investigated the relationship between surgical margin distance and {LRR} in women with invasive breast cancer ({IBC}). {MethodsTumour} free margin distances were extracted from histopathology reports for women with {IBC}, treated by either breast conserving surgery or mastectomy, enrolled in the Breast Cancer Treatment Group Quality Assurance Project from July 1997 to June 2007. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to compare the risk of {LRR} for involved margins compared with negative margins, measured in increments rounded to the nearest mm. Results88 of 2300 patients (3.8\%) experienced an {LRR} after a mean follow-up of 7.9 years. An involved margin, or a margin of 1Â mm was associated with an increased risk of {LRR} ({HR} 2.72, 95\% {CI} 1.30â€“5.69), whilst margin distances of 2Â mm or greater were not. Risk of {LRR} with margin distances {\textless}2Â mm was particularly high amongst those not receiving radiotherapy ({RT}). {ConclusionBased} on our findings, we recommend that a tumour free margin distance of 2Â mm be adopted as an adequate margin of excision for {IBC}, in the setting of patients receiving standard adjuvant {RT} and adjuvant drug therapies as dictated by the current clinical treatment paradigms.},

	abstract = {Our primary objective of this paper was to extend a previously published 2-D coupled subsample tracking algorithm for 3-D speckle tracking in the framework of ultrasound breast strain elastography. In order to overcome heavy computational cost, we investigated the use of a graphic processing unit ({GPU}) to accelerate the 3-D coupled subsample speckle tracking method. The performance of the proposed {GPU} implementation was tested using a tissue-mimicking phantom and in vivo breast ultrasound data. The performance of this 3-D subsample tracking algorithm was compared with the conventional 3-D quadratic subsample estimation algorithm. On the basis of these evaluations, we concluded that the {GPU} implementation of this 3-D subsample estimation algorithm can provide high-quality strain data (i.e., high correlation between the predeformation and the motion-compensated postdeformation radio frequency echo data and high contrast-to-noise ratio strain images), as compared with the conventional 3-D quadratic subsample algorithm. Using the {GPU} implementation of the 3-D speckle tracking algorithm, volumetric strain data can be achieved relatively fast (approximately 20 s per volume [2.5 cm \${\textbackslash}times2.5\$ cm \${\textbackslash}times2.5\$ cm]).},

The method is based on external tissue compression, with subsequent computation of the strain profile along the transducer axis, which is derived from cross-correlation analysis of pre- and post-compression A-line pairs. The strain profile can then be converted to an elastic modulus profile by measuring the stresses applied by the compressing device and applying certain corrections for the nonuniform stress field. We report initial results of several phantom and excised animal tissue experiments which demonstrate the ability of this technique to quantitatively image strain and elastic modulus distributions with good resolution, sensitivity and with diminished speckle.
