\chapter{Discussion}

Due to the smart scanning patterns, phase-sensitive compression OCE systems are capable of scanning a 3D volume in under 2 seconds. From here, the raw spectral data is

\section{Further Computational Speed Ups}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel capabilities of independent looping operations (e.g. any without lateral unwrapping)
\item Convolution on GPUs (need to develop a matlab interface)
\end{itemize}

\section{Next Step}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis in breast tissue
\item Quantitative measurements of elasticity
\item Maintaining image quality with removal of B-scan averaging to decrease acquisition time
\end{itemize}
