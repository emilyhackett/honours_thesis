Overview of thesis goes here
\begin{itemize}
\item Rationale (the problem, real-time margin detection in breast cancer surgery)
\item Solution (OCE scanning of tumour boundaries in surgery)
\item Need (fast strain estimation algorithms)
\item Project (develop strain estimation techniques based on processing speed, and optimise the image quality)
\item Results (found that strain estimation results reliant on finite difference estimated strain combined with Gaussian smoothing was fastest. Adding lateral smoothing significantly increased the sensitivity, and allowed image resolution to be examined). 
\item Further work (parallel application on GPUs to increase the processing speed even further)
\end{itemize}
