	abstract = {Biological tissue has intrinsic optical and mechanical properties that are linked to its structure and function, and are altered by pathologies such as cancer. Techniques for imaging these properties could, thus, aid in the detection, diagnosis, and understanding of disease. Birefringence is one such optical property, arising from structural and molecular anisotropies in tissue and, thus, a measure of the tissue microstructure. Similarly, many pathologies lead to a stiffening or softening of tissues, and, in principle, can be detected from changes in mechanical elasticity. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a minimally invasive optical imaging modality, with micrometre-scale resolution and millimetre-scale depth penetration, which can be extended to measure these tissue properties. This research combines three-dimensional OCT imaging with parametric modelling to develop signal processing methods for spatially resolved micro-scale measurements of tissue birefringence and elasticity, an approach referred to as parametric OCT.},

We define strain sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and derive estimates of strain using three methods: finite difference, ordinary least squares and weighted least squares, the latter implemented for the first time in OCE. We compare theoretical predictions with experimental results and demonstrate a 12 dB improvement in strain sensitivity using weighted least squares compared to finite difference strain estimation and a 4 dB improvement over ordinary least squares strain estimation. We present strain images (i.e., elastograms) of tissue-mimicking phantoms and excised porcine airway, demonstrating in each case clear contrast based on the sample's elasticity.},

Optical coherence micro-elastography incorporates common-path interferometry, weighted averaging of the complex OCT signal and weighted least-squares regression. Using three-dimensional phase unwrapping, we have increased the maximum detectable strain eleven-fold over no unwrapping and the minimum detectable strain is 2.6 μϵ.

However, both the nature of biological signals and the use of micro-or minicomputers in such applications imply the need for simple, low-order, and fast differentiation methods, rather than sophisticated high-order algorithms. Responding to this need, we investigate here the low-pass first- and second-order digital differentiation from both theoretical and practical points of view, in order to achieve good and simple algorithms. In contrast with most of the research works previously done in this field, whose main aim was to achieve better accuracy even in the cost of using quite high-order algorithms, we restrict ourselves in this study only to low orders, being interested not only in the accuracy achieved, but also in the simplicity of the algorithm. After discussing the theoretical considerations concerning our optimum low-pass differentiation filters, we present our simple low-order filters and show them to be not only very convenient for use, but also almost optimum.},

	abstract = {An accurate intraoperative identification of malignant tissue is a challenge in the surgical management of breast cancer. Imaging techniques that help address this challenge could contribute to more complete and accurate tumor excision, and thereby help reduce the current high reexcision rates without resorting to the removal of excess healthy tissue. Optical coherence microelastography (OCME) is a three-dimensional, high-resolution imaging technique that is sensitive to microscale variations of the mechanical properties of tissue. As the tumor modifies the mechanical properties of breast tissue, OCME has the potential to identify, on the microscale, involved regions of fresh, unstained tissue. OCME is based on the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure tissue deformation in response to applied mechanical compression. In this feasibility study on 58 ex vivo samples from patients undergoing mastectomy or wide local excision, we demonstrate the performance of OCME as a means to visualize tissue microarchitecture in benign and malignant human breast tissues. Through a comparison with corresponding histology and OCT images, OCME is shown to enable ready visualization of features such as ducts, lobules, microcysts, blood vessels, and arterioles and to identify invasive tumor through distinctive patterns in OCME images, often with enhanced contrast compared with OCT.
