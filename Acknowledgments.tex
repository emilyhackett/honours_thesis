\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\thispagestyle{empty}

I'd like to thank my supervisors, Dr Brendan Kennedy and Dr Lixin Chin, for their unwavering support and enthusiasm for the project, as well as their wealth of interesting suggestions for the project. 

I would also like to thank Dr Philip Wijesinghe, who was extremely helpful in providing insight to different processing techniques, and aiding in the inevitable debugging.

To Matt Hepburn, for his previous work on strain estimation techniques and image analysis, without which this project wouldn't nearly have gotten so far. Also for generously allowing use of his data sets. 

To the \ac{britelab} research group at Harry Perkins, for being such a welcoming community. 

Lastly to the staff at the School of Physics UWA, in particular Ian McArthur and Darren Grasso, for their continued support throughout my undergraduate degree, as well as the enthusiasm they have inspired in their students for the broad range of areas on which physics can shed light.
