\chapter{Summary of Student Achievements}

During the course of this Honours year, I have achieved a number of things, both within the scope of my Honours project at \ac{britelab} and beyond it. 

\begin{itemize}

\item I have researched and familiarised myself with the processes of the optical coherence elastography imaging technique: where and how it was developed, what it's significant applications are (now and in the future), and in detail how the processing of images works (in a Matlab environment). 

\item I researched and implemented six strain estimation algorithms to assess their use to the \ac{britelab} research group, and evaluated their performance in terms of processing speed as well as image quality metrics (such as sensitivity and image resolution).

\item I did coursework in computing (high performance and scientific), in medical physics areas, as well as doing theoretical physics units on general relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics, to expand my ability to problem solve and to develop skills across specialisations. 

\item I worked within a collaborative research environment, which included attending regular meetings, interacting with visiting academics, and using git version control to develop software efficiently in a team environment.

\item I volunteered throughout the year at Bloom, a student-run organisation for youth entrepreneurship, and saw how connections can be made between undergoing research processes and commercialisation of research on a larger scale, such as the \ac{britelab} research group is currently going through.

\end{itemize}
