\section{Referencing}

Problems exist when determining whether this financial trend indicates an increase in the severity and frequency of these events, or whether it represents a change in society's vulnerability.  Throughout the observational record, shifting criteria for defining extreme events, changes in population densities and lack of suitable homogeneous data render trend identification particularly difficult \citep{easterling:00}.  However, analyses have still been conducted and the general consensus is that the vast bulk of the increased cost of weather events is due to socio-economic factors \citep{changnon(a):00,IPPC:8}, including growth of wealth, demographic shifts to more extreme-weather prone regions and increased insurance penetration.  \citet{changnon(b):00} go so far as to say that this recent shift is almost entirely a consequence of increasing vulnerability.  By adjusting data to reflect the changing societal factors, the authors found essentially no trend, indicating that there has been to date no significant increase in their frequency or intensity.  This slightly contradicts the IPCC finding that the global increase in damage over the past 50 years has been to an extent due to increases in the incidence of the events, including precipitation and flooding \citep{IPPC:8}.  However, notwithstanding this discrepancy, the combined impact of all the studies creates an alarming scenario for both policy-makers and the insurance industry: although climate change as yet seems to have had little impact on the frequency and intensity of these events, society is already very exposed to their impacts.  Thus, if climate change increases the frequency of these events there will be potentially disastrous ramifications.  Moreover, human-induced environmental changes will further increase our vulnerability: deforestation, degradation and loss of biodiversity all amplify the effects of weather related catastrophes \citep{IPPC:8}, by removing the `buffers' provided by nature.

\section{Writing equations}

\begin{equation}
\ {CAPE} = { \int_{LFC}^{EL} {R_d(T_{pseudoadiabat} - T_{sounding})d\ln P}}
\label{equ:cape}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\ \small CAPE = {1 \over 2}R_a \sum_{k=1}^{k=n-1}{[(T_{pa}(k + 1) - T_s(k + 1)) + (T_{pa}(k) - T_s(k))] . [ln {P(k) \over P(k + 1)}]}
\label{equ:11}
\end{equation}
